# 🌐 Nebulai: An AI-Governed Decentralized Cloud Service Economy (Built on SUI)

---

## Abstract

Nebulai is building a decentralized, self-regulating AI-governed cloud service economy on the **SUI blockchain**. Our mission is to create an ecosystem where compute power, storage, and AI agents operate autonomously, transparently, and sustainably — without relying on centralized control. $NEBU is the native token powering this new economy.

## Vision

To build a future where cloud services are governed by algorithms, owned by the people, and impossible to monopolize. A system where the economy, governance, and intelligence evolve together — transparently, sustainably, and collectively.

---

## Key Features

- ✅ **AI-Governed Decision Making**: AI agents manage pricing, resource allocation, uptime, and quality control across nodes.
- ✅ **Decentralized Infrastructure**: Anyone can contribute compute/storage, becoming a node in the Nebulai cloud.
- ✅ **Transparent Tokenomics**: Fixed supply, DAO-controlled treasury, and no private presales.
- ✅ **Social Impact Built-In**: 5% of supply reserved for real-world nonprofit impact (e.g. animal rescue in the Dominican Republic).
- ✅ **Open Ecosystem**: Builders, validators, researchers, and users all share governance power.

## Why SUI?

We chose **SUI** because of its:

- ⚡ Fast transaction finality
- 🧱 Object-centric data model (ideal for complex cloud service graphs)
- 🛠 Active builder ecosystem
- 🛡 Scalable infrastructure for real-world applications

SUI provides the ideal launchpad for a decentralized compute and AI coordination protocol like Nebulai.

## $NEBU Tokenomics

| Category        | Allocation |
|----------------|------------|
| Community DAO  | 50%        |
| LP & Incentives| 20%        |
| Development    | 10%        |
| Ecosystem Grants| 10%       |
| Animal Sanctuary Fund | 5% |
| Human Guardian  | 5%        |

- Max Supply: **1,000,000,000 $NEBU**
- No private or VC allocation.
- DAO-controlled governance from Day 1.

---

## Governance & Autonomy

Nebulai is governed by a hybrid model:
- **AI Agents** handle daily operations, uptime monitoring, reputation scores, and smart contract logic.
- **DAO** (NEBU holders) vote on proposals, upgrades, treasury allocations, and long-term decisions.

All protocol logic is designed to evolve without centralized control. AI models propose upgrades, while the DAO validates and enacts them.

## Roadmap

| Phase | Milestone |
|-------|-----------|
| ✅ Phase 0 | Brand, Whitepaper, Website, Token Deployment |
| ✅ Phase 1 | Launch on SUI, Claimable Airdrop, GitHub Live |
| 🔄 Phase 2 | SUI Token DAO Activation, dApp & CLI Tools |
| 🔜 Phase 3 | Cloud Service API Alpha, AI Node Agents |
| 🔜 Phase 4 | Decentralized Marketplace, Autonomous Agents |

## Real-World Utility & Impact

Nebulai is built not just for speculation — but for function and impact.

- Provide real compute and cloud storage for AI, science, research, and applications.
- Use AI agents to automate and improve uptime, cost-efficiency, and service quality.
- Fund real-world nonprofits directly through chain-native tokenomics (first recipient: **Santuario Animal Puravida**, a rescue shelter in the Dominican Republic).

---

## Transparency

- Code is 100% open-source at [github.com/nebulai-dev](https://github.com/nebulai-dev)
- Wallets and allocations are fully visible onchain.
- Launches with zero private round, zero VC, and zero hype wash — community-first.

## Final Note

Nebulai is more than a project. It’s a step toward a decentralized, intelligent economy — one that rewards participation, eliminates gatekeepers, and funds real good.
